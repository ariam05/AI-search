# Pacman: AI Search

In this project, I recreated the classic version of Pacman, including ghosts and characters. The main focus was on implementing various search algorithms such as minimax, expectimax, and alpha-beta pruning, in order to optimize Pacman's decision-making process in the presence of adversarial agents.

Throughout the project, I utilized Python programming and leveraged the Pacman Classic Game Environment to simulate gameplay scenarios and evaluate the performance of the implemented agents.
